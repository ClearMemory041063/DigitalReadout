# Digital Readout DRO
 
An Arduino circuit that counts the pulses from incremental encoders, typically mounted on machine tools. The values are sent via Bluetooth to an Android application SDRO1

SDRO1 is an Android application that receives data from the previously mentioned circuit and displays the X, Y ,and Z coordinates of the machine tool. It can be used to create patterns of holes such as an angled line of holes or a circular arc of holes (flange holes). It can read a pattern from a CSV file as well.
